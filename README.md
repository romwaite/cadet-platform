# Cadet Platform

About Cadet

Cadet Platform is an open source platform for helping people find their passions.
Working to find resources across the internet and in local communities, the goal is to
allow individuals to explore and develop their passions with an enthusiastic community.
The bigger picture for the platform can be found at igg.me/at/cadet 

There will be 3 academic centered sections, (STEM, Creative Arts, & Public Enterprise), as well as 
an activities section to apply the skills being learned in the academic areas to hobbies and skills we do.

The Practice and Personal sections of the platform discussed on the description will be added once the Passion section
is completed.

# A Day for a User

Let’s say it is a weekday morning for a user that is in school. A typical day would go as follows:

- The Cadet will wake up, do their morning routine (shower, breakfast, and brush teeth), check their devices, and on the way to school go through their morning practice problems which can be focused on warming up for what will be covered that day.

- They arrive at school, the children's devices are queued up to link with the Bluetooth tether on the teacher's computer, and each student's device uploads any models they have created and relevant practice section results for the teacher.

- Students interact with their devices intermittently throughout the day as their schedules permit or can leave them at the collection bay next to the teacher's computer.

- Towards the end of the day, videos and the practice exercises for the night are uploaded to the student's device for the evening.

- At home Cadets can go through practice for the evening, record questions on homework, talk with mentors, work on designing models to print in school, or visit a partner Passion location (e.g. Fabrication lab, dance studio, comedy studio, women’s center).

- Weekend activities would be longer versions of weekday evening activities, namely longer projects and more time at their passion locations.
