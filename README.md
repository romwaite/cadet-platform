# Cadet Platform

About Cadet

Cadet Platform is an open source platform for helping people find their passions.
Working to find resources across the internet and in local communities, the goal is to
allow individuals to explore and develop their passions with an enthusiastic community.
The bigger picture for the platform can be found at igg.me/at/cadet

There will be 3 academic centered sections, (STEM, Creative Arts, & Public Enterprise), as well as 
an activities section to apply the skills being learned in the academic areas to hobbies and skills we do.

The Practice and Personal sections of the platform discussed on the description will be added once the Passion section
is completed.
